# odin-landing-page
Hi guys! As a Landing Page Project for TOP I decided to
sum up some of my ideas to another project I am working on.
 To help myself out with UI I created this landing page as
 a tool to help me decide, which picture I should use in
 my project called "Nem minden hősről írnak könyvet".
  That's exactly why you will have no idea what is going on
 on the web site (the fact that it is in Hungarian doesn't 
 help either) - but it's totally fine. It was primarily 
 created to reflect my brainstroming.
